                Since Japan’s policy of isolationism was ended after the signing of the Kanagawa Treaty in 1854,
                Australia and Japan have enjoyed a turbulent, but largely beneficial relationship. Throughout history,
                Australia and Japan’s interactions have largely been shaped by the two countries’ commercial
                relationships. This is highlighted by Japan’s attempt to modernise in the 20th century, the Dalfram
                dispute, and the rapprochement of ties between Australia and Japan after the Second World War.
                <br>
                Paragraph 2. I should really write this.
                <br>
                The Dalfram Dispute (1938) was a protest by unionists to prevent the exportation of pig iron to Japan
                justified from her invasion of China; highlighting the significance of trade to prevent a nation from
                achieving its expansionistic ambitions. This embargo was meant to slow down the Japanese production of
                weapons which can be “used against the Chinese” and in fear for imperialistic ambitions by Japan, “also
                eventually against Australians” (Australian National University , n.d.). The workers’ protest
                demonstrates the shift in sentiments of the Japanese as being perceived as aggressors thus refusing any
                further trade of raw material, especially pig iron. This restriction reveals Japan’s dependence on
                imported raw material to keep up their war against China showing how commercial relations are
                significant to maintain as it affects the strength of the military. Ted Roach, an Australian trade
                unionist, affirms the council’s policy of stopping pig iron exports to Japan. Roach states that the
                Council endorses the WWF refusal of exporting pig iron to Japan which they suspected it to be used “for
                war purposes” (Illawara Mercury, 1939). This speech by Roach represents the decline but not the end of
                trade relations with Japan as she perceived Japan as a threat which should be slowed down commercially
                but not militarily to prevent any military involvement in the war. The speech by Roach had limited
                reliability. This is because this speech was persuasive attempting to shift the council into his favour
                so he could enact his own goals for the country. However, provides significant insight in how the
                Dalfram Dispute was an action to prevent the ambitions of Japan against China and to reveal the
                significant of trade and how it could slow down a nation lacking necessary resources to prolong the
                campaign.

                When World War Two came to an end, Australia sought to establish a rapprochement with Japan to continue
                trading, even after trade relations soured during World War Two. The relations didn’t completely
                disappear but declined until resuming after the war with the signing of the 1957 commerce agreement.
                This agreement established the “cornerstone of the strong bilateral partnership between our two
                countries [Japan and Australia]” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2017). With this agreement settled, the
                two countries started to value each other as beneficial trading partners in the region. This is
                confirmed by Robert Menzies, the Prime Minister of Australia from 1949-1966 who states that, “Australia
                had sold £139,000,000’s worth of goods to Japan and had bought only £13,000,000” and that “he would
                need many of the things that we could provide and needed to sell” (Robert Menzies Institute, n.d.)
                implying mutual benefits both countries would receive if trade were to occur between the two powers.
                Therefore, the trade with Japan was played a significant role in maintaining a stable relationship
                between the two nations. Furthermore, rather than the military which could’ve sparked tension as
                revealed in World War where Australia was forced to seize its beneficial relations due to the
                ever-increasing power of the Japanese Empire built from its resource gathering from conquering and
                trade. However, the speech by Menzies can be seen to have limited reliability. Despite his positive
                outlook, protests were still happening against trade relations with Japan revealing that Menzies speech
                might’ve not guaranteed all the goals which would benefit Australia’s position in the world-stage for
                trade. But this is still highly useful in describing the significance of how it could alleviate and
                benefit Japan’s post-war conditions and in process, growing Australia’s industry in becoming an
                important individual to partner with in the world-stage.
